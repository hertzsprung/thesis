\chapter{High-order transport for arbitrary meshes}
\label{ch:highOrder}

\TODO{
Motivation
\begin{itemize}	
	\item cubicFit is suitable for flows over steep terrain but it is only second-order convergent despite having a large stencil and a cubic/quadratic polynomial
	\item high-order schemes on coarser meshes can be more computationally efficient than lower-order schemes on finer meshes... sure I saw a citation for this recently
	\item existing high-order FV schemes exist, but are they more computationally expensive? or unsuitable for arbitrary meshes? identify applications of high-order FV schemes to atmospheric models
	\item we want to retain the low computational cost of cubicFit but achieve high-order convergence at the same time
\end{itemize}
}
\TODO{
\begin{itemize}	
\item test: horizontal flow above a mountain on a basic terrain-following mesh \citep{schaer2002,shaw2017} -- the cosBell tracer field might be insufficiently smooth for high-order but still a useful comparison with cubicFit, and returns to the mountainous theme!
\end{itemize}
}
\TODO{somewhere in chapter intro: We define \textit{high-order convergence} as any rate of convergence beyond second-order.}

The cubicFit transport scheme acheives only second-order convergence even though it includes high-order polynomial terms.  The cubicFit scheme uses a sub-grid reconstruction that fits a polynomial over known values stored at cell centre points, and it is this point-wise approach that limits the scheme to second-order convergence.
\citet{devendran2017} developed a high-order finite volume scheme for solving Poissonâ€™s equation, and they achieved high-order convergence by constraining the polynomial fit so that the average of the polynomial integrated over a cell volume equals the cell average value.
We apply their approach to obtain a transport scheme with high-order convergence.
Since it has much in common with the cubicFit transport scheme, we name this high-order transport scheme `highOrderFit'.

\section{Horizontal transport on distorted meshes}
\TODO{
\begin{itemize}
	\item Test: horizontal flow on uniform and cubed-sphere-style Cartesian planes with Gaussian blob, periodic lateral boundary (use the same setup as deformationPlane, just change the velocity field)
	\item Plot: l2/linf convergence plot, cubicFit and highOrderFit
	\item Conclusion: should get fourth-order convergence
\end{itemize}

\section{Transport over mountains}

\TODO{
\begin{itemize}
\item Rerun section~\ref{sec:cubicFit:schaerAdvect} (and section~\ref{sec:cubicFit:tfAdvect}?)
\item Plot highOrderFit results directly onto figure~\ref{fig:cubicFit:schaerAdvect:convergence} (even though it's in the previous chapter)?
\item Using a cos squared tracer we'll only get second-order convergence but maybe absolute accuracy will be improved?
\item highOrderFit is unstable/inaccurate on BTF meshes right now, likely because it's missing cubicFit's stabilisation method
\end{itemize}
