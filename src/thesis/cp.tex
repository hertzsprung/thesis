\chapter{A new test case for exciting the Lorenz computational mode}
\label{ch:cp}

The Lorenz computational mode arises from having one too many degrees of freedom in the Lorenz staggering of variables, and it is often excited by thermal forcing, producing spurious, vertical, grid-scale waves \citep{schneider1987,arakawa-konor1996}.
These errors have been observed in the Global Environmental Multiscale 3 model \citep{girard2014}, and the Korea Institute of Atmospheric Prediction Systems Integrated Model \citep{yi-park2017} amongst others, and these non-physical waves can lead to spurious rainfall in atmospheric models \citep{hollingsworth1995}, inaccurate simulations of idealised hurricanes \citep{zhu-smith2003}, and spurious instabilities in ocean models \citep{bell-white2017}.

The computational mode can be at least partially controlled by using sufficient vertical diffusion \citep{chang1992,zadra2004}, or by using a higher-order vertical discretisation \citep{untch-hortal2004,guerra-ullrich2016,yi-park2017}, but it can only be properly eliminated by choosing an alternative staggering of variables that removes the extra degree of freedom.
One such alternative is the Charney--Phillips staggering.  \citet{thuburn-woolings2005} exhaustively tested different combinations of vertical coordinates, prognostic variables and their staggerings, and found that a Charney--Phillips staggering has better dispersion properties than a Lorenz staggering for any given choice of vertical coordinate and prognostic variables.
\TODO{say where Charney--Phillips is used}
\TODO{say some more advantages of C--P, e.g. \citet{cullen1997} says C--P reduces spurious gravity waves, better geostrophic adjustment}
\TODO{talk about some drawbacks, cite \citep{davies2005} about lowest model layer, \citep{holdaway2013a} -- Lorenz provides cleaner route to ensuring energy conservation}


% what tests cases already exist?  why are they lacking?

%   - what is wrong with this test?
% - hollingsworth1995
%   - 2D model, heating at top, cooling at bottom
% - arakawa-konor1996
%   - standing waves
%   - baroclinic instability test again from arakawa-moorthi1988, does use horizontal finite differences, 2D with Coriolis I think

\TODO{move the following somewhere else when we want to introduce the generalisation of C--P.}
The Charney--Phillips vertical staggering of variables \citep{charney-phillips1953} is suitable for structured meshes with cells stacked in columns.
This staggering has been adopted by several operational models \citep{davies2005,girard2014,yang2007} because it avoids the computational mode that is associated with the Lorenz vertical staggering \citep{arakawa-konor1996}.
The generalisation of the Lorenz staggering for arbitrary meshes is straightforward \citep{weller-shahrokhi2014} but this is not true for the Charney--Phillips staggering.
On a finite volume mesh, variables are ordinarily placed at cell centres or cell faces. In the Charney--Phillips staggering, the thermodynamic variable is placed at only those cell faces that lie on the vertical coordinate surfaces, and vertically-oriented faces have no thermodynamic information.
This existing staggering is unsuitable for arbitrary finite volume meshes because faces can have any orientation.

\TODO{
\begin{itemize}
	\item Test: horizontal advection; advectiveFoamF, advectionFoam with linear interp, advectionFoam with linearUpwind interp; measure l2 and linf errors (s.t. they can be compared with cell-centred, C-grid results); uniform and edgeGraded meshes
	\item Plot: error fields, analytic+numerical contours of final solution, which schemes and which meshes? too many combinations to plot all of them
	\item Plot: time-series of conservation, ExnerFoamH and ExnerFoamCP, uniform mesh, horizontal edgeGrading, vertical edgeGrading
	\item Conclusion: advection is conservative on uniform meshes, non-conservative on non-uniform meshes
	\item Conclusion: advectiveFoamF errors are comparable to advectionFoam with linear interpolation?
	\item Conclusion: advectiveFoamF errors are worse than advectionFoam with linearUpwind interpolation?
