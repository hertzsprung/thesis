The Lorenz computational mode arises from having one too many degrees of freedom in the Lorenz staggering of variables, and it is often excited by thermal forcing, producing spurious, vertical, two-grid alternating waves \citep{schneider1987,arakawa-konor1996}.
In the Lorenz staggering \citep{lorenz1960}, the pressure and vertical velocity variables are staggered, with the thermodynamic variable collocated with the pressure variable (figure~\ref{fig:cp:vertical-staggering:lorenz}).
Hydrostatic models calculate the hydrostatic balance equation and nonhydrostatic models calculate the vertical momentum equation and, in both cases, vertical averaging of the thermodynamic variable means that these spurious grid-scale waves persist because they become invisible to the model \citep{arakawa-konor1996}.
Spurious grid-scale waves have been attributed to the Lorenz computational mode in the Global Environmental Multiscale 3 model \citep{girard2014}, and the Korea Institute of Atmospheric Prediction Systems Integrated Model \citep{yi-park2017} amongst others, and these non-physical waves can lead to spurious rainfall in atmospheric models \citep{hollingsworth1995}, inaccurate simulations of idealised hurricanes \citep{zhu-smith2003}, and spurious instabilities in ocean models \citep{bell-white2017}.

The computational mode can be at least partially controlled by using sufficient vertical diffusion \citep{chang1992,zadra2004}, or by using a higher-order vertical discretisation \citep{untch-hortal2004,guerra-ullrich2016,yi-park2017}, but the computational mode can only be properly eliminated by choosing an alternative staggering of variables that removes the extra degree of freedom.
One such alternative is the Charney--Phillips staggering \citep{charney-phillips1953}, in which the thermodynamic variable is collocated with vertical velocity (figure~\ref{fig:cp:vertical-staggering:cp}), avoiding any vertical averaging in calculating the vertical momentum equation.
Due to the errors associated with the Lorenz computational mode, the Global Environmental Multiscale model switched from a Lorenz staggering to a Charney--Phillips staggering between model versions 3 and 4 \citep{girard2014}, and a Charney--Phillips staggering is also used in the Met Office Unified Model \citep{davies2005} and the Global/Regional Assimilation and Prediction System \citep{yang2007}.
\citet{thuburn-woolings2005} exhaustively tested different combinations of vertical coordinates, prognostic variables and their staggerings, and found that a Charney--Phillips staggering has better dispersion properties than a Lorenz staggering for any given choice of vertical coordinate and prognostic variables.
Numerical experiments performed by \citet{cullen1997} revealed that a model with a Charney--Phillips staggering reduced spurious gravity waves and had better geostrophic adjustment compared to the same model with a Lorenz staggering.

While the Charney--Phillips staggering avoids vertical averaging of the thermodynamic variable in calculating the vertical momentum equation, \citet{davies2005} notes that horizontal pressure gradient calculations can involve vertical averaging of the thermodynamic variable which is inaccurate in the lowest layers where there are strong temperature gradients.
\citet{holdaway2013a} note that, in calculating the Richardson number for boundary layer schemes, averaging that is necessary with the Charney--Phillips staggering is avoided by using a Lorenz staggering.

Previous studies have used a variety of test cases to compare different model variants using Lorenz and Charney--Phillips staggering.
One of the earliest comparisons was made by \citet{arakawa-moorthi1988} who found that, without additional diffusion, their numerical solutions of a baroclinic instability test were dominated by short-wave noise.
Later, \citet{arakawa-konor1996} performed the same test to find that a model using a Charney--Phillips staggering did not suffer from spurious noise, with the Charney--Phillips model needing no additional diffusion.
In the same study, \citet{arakawa-konor1996} proposed new test cases that use thermal forcing to excite the Lorenz computational mode, and these tests clearly reveal spurious grid-scale waves that grow and persist throughout the simulation.
Based on the work of \citet{arakawa-konor1996}, \citet{untch-hortal2004} developed a new test case, using thermal forcing to excite spurious grid-scale waves in a 600-day integration of a global, 3D model.

While these tests have proved useful, they are not ideally suited for dynamical core development: the test case by \citet{untch-hortal2004} is too large \TODO{clarify}, and the test cases by \citet{arakawa-konor1996} were developed only for a simplified, vertically discrete model in pressure coordinates.
Hence, we propose a new, idealised test case on a two-dimensional $x$--$z$ Cartesian plane, based on the work of \citet{arakawa-konor1996}, to compare the accuracy of models using Lorenz or Charney--Phillips staggerings.
The new test case intended to aid the development and intercomparison of modern, nonhydrostatic dynamical cores.  The test completes quickly, using a coarse two-dimensional mesh specified in Cartesian coordinates.
We compare test results between the fully compressible Euler model with a Lorenz staggering (section~\ref{sec:slanted:exnerFoamH}), and a variant of this same model that includes a new generalisation of the Charney--Phillips staggering for arbitrary meshes.

After describing the generalised Charney--Phillips formulation in section~\ref{sec:cp:method}, we compare Lorenz and generalised Charney--Phillips model variants in section~\ref{sec:cp:schaerWaves} using the standard mountain waves test case specified by \citet{schaer2002}.
Section~\ref{sec:cp:arakawaKonor} presents the new test case based on the original test specified by \citet{arakawa-konor1996}.
We verify that the Lorenz computational mode is excited using the fully compressible Euler model with a Lorenz staggering, and we verify that the Charney--Phillips model variant is free of spurious grid-scale waves.  Finally, we explore the sensitivity to mesh distortions using the generalised Charney--Phillips model variant.
