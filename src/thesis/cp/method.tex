\section{Generalising the Charneyâ€“Phillips staggering for arbitrary meshes}
\label{sec:cp:method}

The generalisation of the Lorenz staggering for arbitrary meshes is straightforward \citep{weller-shahrokhi2014} but this is not true for the Charney--Phillips staggering, which is only suitable for structured meshes with cells stacked in columns.
On a finite volume mesh, variables are ordinarily placed at cell centres or cell faces.
In the Charney--Phillips staggering, the thermodynamic variable is placed at only those cell faces that lie on the vertical coordinate surfaces, and vertically-oriented faces have no thermodynamic information.
This existing staggering is unsuitable for arbitrary finite volume meshes because faces can have any orientation.
