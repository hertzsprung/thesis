\section{Stratified atmosphere initially at rest}

\TODO{
\begin{itemize}
	\item Meshes: BTF, cut cell, slanted cell (with upward vertex shifts), SLEVE?
	\item Schemes: cubicFit, linearUpwind?
	\item Plot: time series of max(abs(w)) for $h_0=\SI{1}{\kilo\meter}$?
	\item Plot: time-average or time-maximum of max(abs(w)) versus $h_0$ (like mountainAdvect:l2ByMountainHeight)
	\item Conclusion: slanted cells have spurious velocities comparable to cut cells, much better than BTF, somewhat better than SLEVE
\end{itemize}
