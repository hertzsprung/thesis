\caption{Illustration of a slanted cell mesh
(\subcaptionref{fig:slanted:construct-mesh:before}) before, and
(\subcaptionref{fig:slanted:construct-mesh:after}) after construction.
	The terrain surface, denoted by a heavy dotted line, intersects a uniform rectangular mesh comprising six cells, $c_1, \ldots, c_6$.
	The cell vertices, marked by open circles, are moved to the points at which the terrain intersects vertical cell edges, marked by filled circles.  Cells that have no volume are removed.  Where a cell has two vertices occupying the same point, the zero-length edge that joins those vertices is removed.
	In this illustration, cells $c_5$ and $c_6$ are removed because they have no volume, and the zero-length edge at point $q$ is removed to create a triangular cell, $c_4$.
	Point $p$ is moved down because it is within $2 \Delta z/5$ of the surface, avoiding the creation of a thin cell.}

Starting from a uniform rectangular mesh, all cell vertices that lie beneath the orography are moved up to the surface.
Additionally, to avoid creating very thin cells, all vertices up to $2 \Delta z/5$ above the orography \TODO{can be... should we enable this behaviour in all tests for consistency?} moved down to the surface.
Where all four of a cell's vertices are moved, the cell has zero volume and so it is removed.  Where two vertices at the same horizontal location are moved up to the surface they will occupy the same point; this results in a zero-length edge that is removed to create a triangular cell.
Figure~\ref{fig:slanted:construct-mesh} shows how a $2 \times 3$-cell, uniform rectangular mesh is transformed into a slanted cell mesh.  Cells $c_5$ and $c_6$ are removed because they have zero volume, and the zero-length edge at point $q$ is removed to create a triangular cell, $c_3$.
Point $p$ is moved down because it is within $2\Delta z/5$ of the surface, avoiding the creation of a very thin cell.

The slanted cell method does generate some small cells but, unlike the cut cell method, the width of slanted cells is never altered.  Hence, slanted cell meshes should not suffer from severe time-step constraints associated with arbitrarily small cut cells.
