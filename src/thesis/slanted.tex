\chapter{A new mesh for representing the atmosphere above terrain}
\label{ch:slanted}

\begin{highlights}
{\Large Highlights}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The new slanted cell mesh permits longer time-steps than cut cells, with time-steps comparable to terrain-following meshes
	\item Pressure gradient calculations are more accurate using the new slanted cell method compared to terrain-following methods
	\item Unlike the multidimensional linear upwind scheme, the cubicFit scheme is numerically stable over very steep slopes
\end{itemize}
\end{highlights}

\TODO{motivation, \url{https://github.com/hertzsprung/thesis/wiki/Slanted-cells}}

We seek a new type of mesh that improves pressure gradients calculations compared to terrain-following methods, and avoids the severe time-step constraints associated with arbitrarily small cut cells.  Section~\ref{sec:slanted:method} describes the slanted cell method which is designed to satisfy these criteria.
Section~\ref{sec:slanted:mountainAdvect} presents a new two-dimensional test that challanges transport schemes by transporting a tracer along the ground through slanted cells.
