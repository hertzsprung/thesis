\chapter{A new mesh for representing the atmosphere above terrain}
\label{ch:slanted}

\begin{highlights}
{\Large Highlights}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The new slanted cell mesh permits longer time-steps than cut cells, with time-steps comparable to terrain-following meshes
	\item Pressure gradient calculations are more accurate using slanted cells compared to terrain-following meshes
	\item Unlike the multidimensional linear upwind scheme, the cubicFit scheme is numerically stable over very steep slopes
\end{itemize}
\end{highlights}

\TODO{
Motivation
\begin{itemize}
	\item cut cells can improve pressure gradient accuracy over TF layers, but they have arbitrarily small cells and they're not simple to construct
	\item we seek a mesh that improves pressure gradient errors, but avoids arbitrarily small cells and is easier to construct than cut cell meshes
	\item to ensure cubicFit is numerically stable and accurate on slanted cell meshes with steep slopes, we transport a tracer along the ground through the slanted cells
\end{itemize}
