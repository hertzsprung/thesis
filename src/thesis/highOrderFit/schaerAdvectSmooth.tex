\section{Transport over mountains}
\label{sec:highOrderFit:schaerAdvectSmooth}

\TODO{
\begin{itemize}
\item Use $\cos^4$ tracer (as justified by \citet{holdaway2008})
\item Use original setup by \citet{schaer2002}: $h_0 = \SI{3}{\kilo\meter}$ and the original velocity field, test on BTF and cut cells, compare cubicFit and highOrderFit, RK4 throughout, max Co = 0.4ish
\item Conclusion: 4th-order convergence on uniform mesh with $\cos^4$ and highOrderFit
\item Conclusion: 3rd-order convergence on BTF mesh with $\cos^4$ with both schemes?  This is a surprise result for cubicFit!  Can we guess why this happens?
\item Should I present $cos^2$ results here, too?  Those results support the theory of \citet{holdaway2008} but don't tell us much else.  They also make the convergence plots kinda messy.
\end{itemize}
